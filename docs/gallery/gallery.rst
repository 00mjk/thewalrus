Non-Gaussian states gallery
###########################


Here you can find a curated list of Gaussian circuits and photon-number-resolved measurements to prepare non-Gaussian states of interest in quantum optics, information, metrology and computing.

The original idea of using general Gaussian states and photon-number-resolved measurements to generate complex non-Gaussian states was introduced by K.K. Sabapathy, H. Qi, J. Izaac, and C. Weedbrook in `Phys. Rev. A 100, 012326, (2019) <https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012326>`_ and it was further theoretically analyzed by D. Su, C.R. Myers, and K.K. Sabapathy in `Phys. Rev. A 100, 052301, (2019) <https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.052301>`_ and `arXiv:1902.02331 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02331>`_.


If you develop a new circuit and measurement scheme to prepare a non-Gaussian state, add it to the gallery!
